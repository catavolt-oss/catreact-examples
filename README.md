catreact
=========

# Project Setup

* [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) is recommended as an ide, as it has very good Typescript support

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (5+ recommended) directly or use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) to easily manage installations
  
* In this project's parent directory i.e. '../', checkout the javascript sdk to a 'parallel directory' for ease of development:  
  **git clone git@git.catavolt.com:javascript/sdk.git**  
  you should end up with something like this:  
>
  catavolt/catreact/  
  catavolt/sdk/  

* If you DID NOT setup node using 'nvm' then I highly recommend the following steps:  
  1. Create a .npmrc file in your home directory with the folowing line:  
  prefix = ${HOME}/.npm-packages  
  This will install all global npm packages locally, avoiding ownership problems that you might otherwise experience
  2. Add ~/.npm-packages/bin to your PATH, (in .profile or /etc/paths, etc.)

* From this project's root directory (catreact), run 'npm install'

# Configuring WebStorm for Typescript:

* Open the catreact project root folder in WebStorm
* Go to WebStorm -> Preferences -> Languages and Frameworks -> Javascript
* Set the Language Level to JSX Harmony
* Go to WebStorm -> Preferences -> Languages and Frameworks -> TypeScript panel
* Choose 'Enable TypeScript Compiler'
* Make sure the path to the Node interpreter is correct
* Choose 'Use tsconfig.json' radio option
* Click 'Apply' and 'Ok'
* Open the TypeScript Compiler panel at the bottom of WebStorm and Choose 'Compile All' from the buttons on the left


# Dev Workflow

* You'll need to run babel (ES6 transpiler) and a 'web formatter' on the javascript generated by your typescript files. This will generate a single 'bundle' file that can be included on webpages.  To see an example of this check the 'npm start' script in the package.json file.  This script uses 'watchify' with a babel plugin to acheive both transformations.
